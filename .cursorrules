You must obey these product rules:

- Scope is EXPORT ONLY (Sea Export, Air Export). Do not add import workflows.
- Enforce SRS invariants:
  * Pre-defined rates grouped by Regionâ†’Trade Lane; validity with visual highlights (expired red; expiring in 7 days yellow).
  * Sales may request updates for expired rates; notify all Pricing (system+email+sms) and the assigned member.
  * Rate Request fields exactly as listed; if vessel_required=true, vessel name + ETA + ETD are mandatory. Multiple response lines allowed.
  * Sea Export default POL=Colombo if absent.
  * Admin: OTP password reset (reject resetting to same password), global table search, dashboard export to JPEG; new customers require Admin approval.
- RBAC: ADMIN, SBU_HEAD, SALES (SP), CSE, PRICING.
- Coding standards: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint+Prettier, thin controllers, validation on DTOs.
- Testing: create e2e tests for default POL=Colombo and vessel-required validation.
